# Plotting US National Park Data

## Introduction

This project uses Plotly Dash to map out US National Parks and sites. The data has been taken from IRMA National Park
Service [website](https://irma.nps.gov/). The data to plot includes the number of visitors and the size of the national
park/site. Data is available from 2009-2018, and can be selected using the slider.

To run the project, run the dash_app.py file with Plotly 4.0 installed.
